Description

The 6 Cs are the standard criteria for reports, requirements, and other works—written, verbal, or otherwise—that need to be implemented, quantified, or otherwise used in a precise manner. They can, however, be used for all types of communication. Based on a number of similar systems involving C words, they form a general checklist that authors can use for both technical and abstract communication, so long as "concrete" is taken a bit more loosely. They are provided in their general order of importance, clarity coming in first place and completeness near the end (everything can be fixed later!). Also note that any set of items that gets analyzed must be checked individually *and* as a group: sometimes all the individual parts work but the system as a whole can still fail.
