(Glossary)

(Signup)
We start out on the homepage, and from there we click the login button ->
We then navigate to the signup page using the button to the left as a new user would ->
The user must enter a unique username and email, a password that is at least 6 charectors long and contains a uppercase letter, lowercase letter, and a number ->
They must also provide their state of residence and birthdate in order to prove they are at least 18 years old and a residence of the USA ->
Once they have read the Terms and Conditions (I'll open a tab to show the page) which are outlined on this page, they may create an account ->
The Terms and conditions page includes our privacy policy, terms of use, cookie policy, and HIPPA privacy practices ->
Now if we return to our signup page, for our user, we'll use the username newUser, one of our emails as the email, newPassword1 as the password, and march 17, 1995 as the birthdate (signup button clicked)->
When the account is created, a verification email is sent to the user and (account attempts to login), as we can see, the login is denied because the account is not verified ->
So if we go to our email, we'll see we've recieved a verification email and when we click the link, our account will be activated ->
As you can see, the user is already logged in ->

(Forgot Password)
Now, in-case the user forgets their password, they can reset their password through their email using the forgot password link ->
Here the user enters an email, in this case the email of the user we just created ->
The email is checked against existing users and a link is sent to the account ->
Once the user clicks the link, they will be taken to a form where they may reset their password using the same requirements for the original signup ->
In this case, we'll change it to newPassword2 and when we go to login in again, you'll have to trust us that its changed ->

(Glossary)
On the dashboard and other data focused pages, we may have terms that the user could be unfamiliar with such as HbA1c (HbA1c is clicked) ->
These terms are hyperlinked to a glossary page, providing definitions to uninformed users from a reputable source ->
Aside from the dashboard and analytics page, these terms are also linked on the input forms page, where they can be hovered over to get a pop-up definition or clicked like the rest of the terms ->
