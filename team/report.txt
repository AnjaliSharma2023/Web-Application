1. Introduction

+++
2. Project Plan

===
2.1. Project Description

Team 6 will be creating GlucoCheck, a program to track glucose and insulin levels. This program will offer a secure, web-based, DB-backed UI for users to create an account, log in, and input health data. Users will be able to visualize this data, as well as receive different dietary recommendations based upon it.

===
2.2. Project Background

The biggest challenge will be providing a secure, easy-to-use interface for customers to be able to interpret their health data. While there is no shortage of tools to measure glucose, few of those tools provide data visualization or personalized dietary recommendations that allow the customer to go from numbers to knowledge. This will be a vital learning experience for the team because customers very rarely want data, or software, or even logins: they want concrete answers, simplifications, and convenience. By applying programming techniques to a real-world problem in the healthcare industry, members will be able to understand how to make use of their technical knowledge in a supporting role for a useful, profitable business.

2.3. Project Goals

• Enable my customers to sign up and login securely during 1st Sprint.
• Enable my customers to input and review their health data during 1st Sprint.
• Enable my customers to visualize and understand their health data during 2nd Sprint.
• Enable my customers to use the app on any web browser during 2nd Sprint.
• Enable my customers to receive custom dietary recommendations during 3rd Sprint.
• Enable my customers to access instructions and help documentation during 3rd Sprint.
• Enable my customers to export health data during 3rd Sprint.

2.3.1. Resources Required

• Customer UI testing
• Sample health data

---
2.3.2. Project Constraints

• Basic medical knowledge
• Data visualization experience
• Customer safety and regulations
• USDA food data server rate limits

2.4. Product Vision Statement

GlucoCheck
For diabetics and their caregivers
Who need help monitoring, tracking, and managing blood sugar levels and stopping dietary glucose spikes,
The program GlucoCheck
Is a simple, easy-to-use, and clear web-based personal logbook
That allows even non-professionals to log in from anywhere, input insulin and glucose levels, visualize the changes over time, get reminders, and receive dietary recommendations.
Unlike competitors—such as Omnipod and Medtronic, which focus heavily on bolus doses and medical intervention to manage diabetes—
Our product also offers lifestyle changes and USDA/FDA-approved meal ideas for controlling blood sugar spikes with a more holistic approach that treats the whole person.
