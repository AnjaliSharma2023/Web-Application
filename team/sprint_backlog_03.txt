Description

The development team's sprint backlog for sprint 3, which can be subdivided into smaller and smaller chunks—even into tasks instead of stories.

+++
Overview

**Sprint**: 3
**Start date**: 2021-03-28
**End date**: 2021-04-17
**Goal**: Provide better data input, dietary advice, and more general polish to the user to aid in differentiation and customer retention.

Backlog

///
The sprint backlog format supplements the product backlog format, allowing a quick overview of all subtasks for a given user story. Instead of using bullet points, all tasks are given the NKMF-standard shorthand for authorship info: either a "+" (task created), "=" (task in progress), or "#" (task completed). The parentheses hold the date the item was last modified (ISO 8601 as always, please—it is the worldwide standard!), the task follows, and the person who last updated the task should be in parenthesis at the end. It is recommended that a person only have 1 or 2 in-progress tasks ("=") at a time so as not to lock anyone else out of a task unnecessarily, though tasks can be shared if they are very large (better to break them down, though, normally). For example:

"""
•• (2) Management Infrastructure: As a scrum master, I want...
+ (2021-01-31) Create critical path algorithm (Jeremiah)
# (2021-02-14) Create sprint backlog format (Jeremiah)
= (2021-02-14) Update schedule (Jeremiah)

Done

Items that are now in the past; the team may move user stories to this category whenever they think they meet the acceptance criteria. Once verified, the *product owner* must put the story inside a description list, with the term (or key) being the date the story was accepted.


///
Definition Of Done

1. Each acceptance criteria has been fully met.
2. Each acceptance criteria has at least 1 test.
3. All tests pass.
4. All custom classes and functions have at least a minimal docstring.
5. The feature is live in the repo, either currently deployed or ready to deploy immediately.
\\\

===
Doing

The *one* story—and any subitems—that are presently in progress. Only the dev team may pull an item into this category and they may freely create subitems, as needed: this is the place to break a story down.

===
Do

The agreed-upon user stories for the sprint, ready for future work by the development team. The team may add to this list by mutual agreement at any time but no extra work may be pushed to the team during a sprint.

••• (10) Generate Approved Advice: As a developer, I want to provide generic advice and alerts based on the health data and metrics so that I do not give regulated medical advice. (1. Is legally unregulated. 2. Is safe. 3. Is accurate. 4. Is based upon both the customer's health data and the metrics. 5. Incorporates dietary information. 6. Is actionable.)
+ (2021-03-29) Rework test data generation (Team)
+ (2021-03-29) Create an algorithm to identify unsafe glucose trends (Team)
+ (2021-03-29) Create an algorithm to identify unsafe carb trends (Team)
+ (2021-03-29) Create a list of unregulated, safe, and actionable statements (Team)

••• (5) Input Health Data Via API: As a developer, I want to automate data entry so that advanced users or hardware can quickly and accurately input large amounts of health data. (1. Provides a public-facing API that allows programmatic mass data entry after authentication. 2. Documents the API for users.)
= (2021-03-29) Setup POST request authentication (Anjali)
+ (2021-03-29) Write documents (Team)

•• (1) Provide Definitions: As a customer, I want descriptions of app-related medical terms so that I can understand my health better. (1. From a recognized medical authority. 2. With a hyperlink to a .org or .gov source. 3. Covering all medical terms used on the website.)
+ (2021-03-29) Determine our source (Team)
= (2021-03-29) Develop initial list of 10–15 terms (Stuart)
+ (2021-03-29) Find JS script to auto-hyperlink terms (Team)

•• (2) Provide Optimum Metrics: As a customer, I want to understand the optimum range for health data so that I can keep the numbers in check. (1. From a recognized medical authority. 2. With a hyperlink to a .org or .gov source. 3. Covering all metrics used on the website. 4. Contextualized and/or integrated into the visualization.)
+ (2021-03-29) Determine our source (Team)
