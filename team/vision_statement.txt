**For**: diabetics and their caregivers
**Who**: need help monitoring, tracking, and managing blood sugar levels and stopping dietary glucose spikes,
**The**: program GlucoCheck
**Is a**: simple, easy-to-use, and clear web-based personal logbook
**That**: allows even non-professionals to log in from anywhere, input insulin and glucose levels, visualize the changes over time, get reminders, and receive dietary recommendations.

**Unlike**: competitors—such as Omnipod and Medtronic, which focus heavily on bolus doses and medical intervention to manage diabetes—
**Our product**: also offers lifestyle changes and USDA/FDA-approved meal ideas for controlling blood sugar spikes with a more holistic approach that treats the whole person.
