Description

One of many possible precursors to a product backlog, the product roadmap is akin to an SRS. It turns the product vision into a series of discrete requirements, starting with the identification of stakeholders and the establishment of baseline qualities. Once the requirements are set, any dependencies can be noted and the complexity estimated in terms of the triple constraints: scope, time, and resources.

Vision

For diabetics and their caregivers, who need help monitoring, tracking, and managing blood sugar levels and stopping dietary glucose spikes, the program GlucoCheck is a simple, easy-to-use, and clear web-based personal logbook that allows even non-professionals to log in from anywhere, input insulin and glucose levels, visualize the changes over time, get reminders, and receive dietary recommendations. Unlike competitors—such as Omnipod and Medtronic, which focus heavily on bolus doses and medical intervention to manage diabetes—our product also offers lifestyle changes and USDA/FDA-approved meal ideas for controlling blood sugar spikes with a more holistic approach that treats the whole person.
