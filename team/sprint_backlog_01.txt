Description

The development team's sprint backlog for sprint 1, which can be subdivided into smaller and smaller chunks—even into tasks instead of stories.

+++
Overview

**Sprint**: 1
**Start date**: 2021-02-07
**End date**: 2021-02-27
**Goal**: Set up a compliant, secure website that allows users to signup and login to the app.

+++
Backlog

///
The sprint backlog format supplements the product backlog format, allowing a quick overview of all subtasks for a given user story. Instead of using bullet points, all tasks are given the NKMF-standard shorthand for authorship info: either a "+" (task created), "=" (task in progress), or "#" (task completed). The parentheses hold the date the item was last modified (ISO 8601 as always, please—it is the worldwide standard!), the task follows, and the person who last updated the task should be in parenthesis at the end. It is recommended that a person only have 1 or 2 in-progress tasks ("=") at a time so as not to lock anyone else out of a task unnecessarily, though tasks can be shared if they are very large (better to break them down, though, normally). For example:

"""
•• (2) Management Infrastructure: As a scrum master, I want...
+ (2021-01-31) Create critical path algorithm (Jeremiah)
# (2021-02-14) Create sprint backlog format (Jeremiah)
= (2021-02-14) Update schedule (Jeremiah)
"""

===
Done

Items that are now in the past; only the *product owner* may move user stories to this category when they meet the acceptance criteria or, in the case of dev-team-created subitems, the internal definition of done.

===
Doing

The *one* story—and any subitems—that are presently in progress. Only the dev team may pull an item into this category and they may freely create subitems, as needed: this is the place to break a story down.
••• (1) Geofenced Distribution: As a developer, I want to make sure the customer has a valid zip code so that they are in a jurisdiction covered by the legal disclaimer. - Done
•• (5) Secure Login: As a developer, I want to provide privacy and protection for my customers so that their information is not shared. - Done

• (2) Legal Disclaimer: As a lawyer, I want to read a disclaimer so that my client's PHI is protected. (1. Protects PHI according to HIPAA. 2. Uses proven language. 3. Is prominently displayed.)

===
Do

The agreed-upon user stories for the sprint, ready for future work by the development team. The team may add to this list by mutual agreement at any time but no extra work may be pushed to the team during a sprint.
•• (2) Freemium Model: As a customer, I want to be able to use some of GlucoCheck's features for free so that I do not have to pay for them. (1. Is built into the website and/or backend. 2. Provides at least 1 paid tier. 3. Locks non-paying users out of paid tiers.)
