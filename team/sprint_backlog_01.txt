**Legal Disclaimer

===
Done

Items that are now in the past; only the *product owner* may move user stories to this category when they meet the acceptance criteria or, in the case of dev-team-created subitems, the internal definition of done.

===
Doing

The *one* story—and any subitems—that are presently in progress. Only the dev team may pull an item into this category and they may freely create subitems, as needed: this is the place to break a story down.

===
Do

The agreed-upon user stories for the sprint, ready for future work by the development team. The team may add to this list by mutual agreement at any time but no extra work may be pushed to the team during a sprint.
