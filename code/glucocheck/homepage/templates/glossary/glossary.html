		<a id="A1C"><h2>A1C</h2></a><hr>
		<p>a test that measures a person's average blood sugar level over the past 2 to 3 months. Hemoglobin (HEE-mo-glo-bin) is the part of a red blood cell that carries oxygen to the cells and sometimes joins with the glucose in the bloodstream. Also called hemoglobin A1C or glycosylated (gly-KOH-sih-lay-ted) hemoglobin, the test shows the amount of glucose that sticks to the red blood cell, which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the blood.</p><br>

        <a id="glucose-monitoring"><h2>blood glucose monitoring</h2></a><hr>
		<p>checking blood sugarlevel on a regular basis in order to manage diabetes. A blood sugar meter (or blood glucose test strips that change color when touched by a blood sample) is needed for frequent blood glucose monitoring.</p><br>

        <a id="carbohydrate"><h2>carbohydrate (kar-boh-HY-drate)</h2></a><hr>
		<p>one of the three main nutrients in food. Foods that provide carbohydrate are starches, vegetables, fruits, dairy products and sugars.</p><br>
        
        <a id="carbohydrate-counting"><h2>carbohydrate counting</h2></a><hr>
		<p>a method of meal planning for people with diabetes based on counting the number of grams of carbohydrate in food.</p><br>

        <a id="fasting-blood"><h2>fasting blood glucose test</h2></a><hr>
		<p>a check of a person's blood sugarlevel after the person has not eaten for 8 to 12 hours (usually overnight). This test is used to diagnose pre-diabetes and diabetes. It is also used to monitor people with diabetes.</p><br>
        
        <a id="glucose"><h2>glucose</h2></a><hr>
		<p>one of the simplest forms of sugar.</p><br>
    
        <a id="insulin"><h2>insulin</h2></a><hr>
		<p>a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. The beta cells of the pancreas make insulin. When the body cannot make enough insulin, it is taken by injection or through use of an insulin pump.</p><br>
    
        <a id="mg-dL"><h2>mg/dL</h2></a><hr>
		<p>milligrams (MILL-ih-grams) per deciliter (DESS-ih-lee-tur), a unit of measure that shows the concentration of a substance in a specific amount of fluid. In the United States, blood sugartest results are reported as mg/dL. Medical journals and other countries use millimoles per liter (mmol/L). To convert to mg/dL from mmol/L, multiply mmol/L by 18. Example: 10 mmol/L �18 = 180 mg/dL.</p><br>

        <a id="mmol-L"><h2>mmol/L</h2></a><hr>
		<p>millimoles per liter, a unit of measure that shows the concentration of a substance in a specific amount of fluid. In most of the world, except for the United States, blood sugartest results are reported as mmol/L. In the United States, milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) is used. To convert to mmol/L from mg/dL, divide mg/dL by 18. Example: 180 mg/dL × 18 = 10 mmol/L.</p><br>
